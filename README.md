# Pre-work - tips

tips is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Marc Conner

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

## Notes
I struggled with following along with parts of the tutorial video because of updates to the swift code where functions were slightly changed.

        let tipPercentage = tipPercentages[tipControl.selectedSegmentIndex]
        
        let billAmount = Double(billField.text!)
        let tip = billAmount! * tipPercentage
        let total = billAmount! + tip
        
        tipLabel.text = "$\(tip)"
        totalLabel.text = "$\(total)"
        
        tipLabel.text = String(format: "$%.2f", tip)
        totalLabel.text = String(format: "$%.2f", total)
        
    }
    @IBAction func OnTap(sender: AnyObject) {
        view.endEditing(true)
